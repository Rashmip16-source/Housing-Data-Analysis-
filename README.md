# Housing-Data-Analysis-
Analyzing housing data using Python typically involves several steps, from data loading and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling. Here’s a structured explanation on how I approached this task, focusing on variables like house prices, area, number of bedrooms, parking facility, and type of house.

Firstly, understanding the structure and contents of the dataset is important.
 This includes variables such as:
 
•	House Prices: The target variable you want to predict.
•	Area: The size of the property in square feet or square meters.
•	Number of Bedrooms: Indicates the size of the house.
•	Parking Facility: Whether the property has parking space available (yes/no).
•	Type of House: Whether it is furnished, unfurnished, or semi-furnished.

Each of these variables provides different insights into what influences house prices and how they relate to each other.

Visualizations such as histograms show the distribution of house prices and property sizes, while scatter plots reveal relationships like how prices vary with property area or number of bedrooms. Bar charts display categorical data like parking availability and Pie charts display type of house (furnished, unfurnished), highlighting their impact on prices. Box plots summarize price distributions across different house types, and heatmaps indicate correlations between features like area, bedrooms, and prices, aiding in understanding market trends and making informed decisions in real estate.

Conclusion: analyzing housing data reveals that factors such as property size (area) and number of bedrooms significantly impact house prices. Properties with parking facilities and higher levels of furnishing (like fully furnished) tend to command higher prices due to increased desirability and convenience. Understanding these factors helps stakeholders make informed decisions in real estate investments and pricing strategies, reflecting broader market trends and economic conditions.
